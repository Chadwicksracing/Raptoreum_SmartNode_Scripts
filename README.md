# Raptoreum SmartNode
Script needs to be ran under a sudo user and not under root. It will install binaries, configure basic firewall settings, and create a daemon service for you.

> â„¹ Note: This has only been tested on Ubuntu 18 but should work on 16. USE AT OWN RISK.

## Installation
Create a sudo user and run this under that sudo user. Script will exit if ran under root.
